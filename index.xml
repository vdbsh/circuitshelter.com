&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/software/">The Internet Archive Software Collection&lt;/a>: largest vintage and historical software library in the world, providing instant access to millions of programs, CD-ROM images, documentation and multimedia. The collection includes a broad range of software related materials including shareware, freeware, video news releases about software titles, speed runs of actual software game play, previews and promos for software games, high-score and skill replays of various game genres, and the art of filmmaking with real-time computer game engines.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.mobygames.com/">MobyGames&lt;/a>: is the oldest, largest and most accurate video game database. Spanning over 260 platforms from 1950 to date. For 20 years, it&amp;rsquo;s been widely considered the IMDB of the games industry and often referenced as the canonical source for game information.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/">The Macintosh Garden&lt;/a>: is an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware&lt;/a> archive, dedicated in particular to supporting the Macintosh computer platform. A notable feature of Macintosh Garden is its emphasis on emulation, encouraging users to run historical software on modern systems. Software featured on the Macintosh Garden has been discontinued by their publishers and is no longer commercially available. The Macintosh Garden aims to preserve these treasures for future generations, providing documentation and downloads of the original files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.tosecdev.org/">TOSEC&lt;/a>: The Old School Emulation Center (TOSEC) is a retrocomputing initiative dedicated to the cataloging and preservation of software, firmware and resources for microcomputers, minicomputers and video game consoles. The main goal of the project is to catalog and audit various kinds of software and firmware images for these systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/">My Abandonware&lt;/a>: was created in February 2009. Over the years, thousands of games have been added to the site. Authors want to create the best video game museum on the web and let everyone around the world enjoy the incredible amount of great software created in the 80s and 90s. 18k+ games are available at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://redump.org/">Redump.org&lt;/a>: is an disc preservation database and internet community dedicated to collecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever released on optical media of any system. The goal is to make blueprints of the data on console and PC game discs. Redump also provides guides to ensure the dumps are correctly done. Users of the website who follow the guides correctly are encouraged to share their results to help build the database. Multiple dumps of games with the same serial number by different people are collected to ensure the same results are gathered, which help correct any incorrect dumps in the database as well as to help recognize alternate versions of the same game.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Browservice server uses CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) to run a Chromium browser instance that renders the browser view into an off-screen buffer. The browser view, combined with a control UI bar, is then compressed as a PNG or JPEG image and served to the client using an embedded HTTP server. The client browser runs a JavaScript application that requests and shows the images. It also listens for keyboard and mouse events from the user and forwards them to the proxy by including them in the URLs of the image requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, this approach of sending the whole browser view as a new image every time it changes might sound quite inefficient. However, it is surprisingly usable if the network connection between the proxy server and the client is fast (such as 100 Mbit/s Ethernet LAN). Early 00s hardware (~1 GHz CPU clock) can often surpass 10 FPS in video streaming. The performance is also tolerable on older machines if a low JPEG compression level is used and the browser window is small.&lt;/p>
