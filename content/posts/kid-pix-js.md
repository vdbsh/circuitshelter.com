Kid Pix is a bitmap drawing program designed for children. Originally created by Craig Hickman, it was first released for the Macintosh in 1989 and subsequently published in 1991 by Broderbund. Hickman was inspired to create Kid Pix after watching his son Ben struggle with MacPaint, and thus the main idea behind its development was to create a drawing program that would be very simple to use. Since then a lot of people from all over the world have great memories about this friendly drawing app.

# JS Kid Pix
**Now you can experience it as well by this web app: https://kidpix.app/**

JS Kid Pix / Kid Pix 1.0 was released in to the public domain and this is an HTML/JS reimplementation.

Just like the original Kid Pix, there's no guide—have fun! Most of the tools support Shift (^) to enlarge. There are a handful of hidden tool features behind various modifier keys (⌘, ⌥, ⇧). The modifier keys can also be combined.

Another honourable mention is [Tux Paint](http://www.tuxpaint.org/), it follows the same principles and available on Linux, macOS and Windows.
