Widelands is a free, open source real-time strategy game with singleplayer campaigns and a multiplayer mode. The game was inspired by Settlers II™ (© Bluebyte) but has significantly more variety and depth to it. 

Since the release of Build 21, developers implemented several hundreds of new features and bugfixes; for example, to name just a few of the highlights:

    A new tribe: the Amazons
    An add-on system
    A third frisians scenario
    Dynamic tribe loading to speed up game loading
    Targeting individual map objects for removal
    Mute/unmute messages by buildings
    Fully redesigned main menu
    Configurable keyboard shortcuts
    Enhanced keyboard and mousewheel support in the UI
    Long-term stable Lua API for game content designers
