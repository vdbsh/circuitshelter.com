If you are experiencing flickering or resizing glitches in fullscreen in macOS this trick can help:

# Preferences > Show All

## Interfaces
* **Main Interfaces** > macosx > ```[v]``` Use the native fullscreen mode
* **Main Interfaces** > macosx > ```[ ]``` Resize interface to the native video size

## Video
* ```[ ]``` Embed video

This is quite a mystery why attached playlist cause drawing defects, hopefully this will be fixed in upcoming versions.
