**Software is not always a tool or a solution.**
And it doesn’t always need to serve a high purpose or solve problems.

Coding is a very accessible form of expression that can be applied to virtually anything including  things not related to your job or interests.
You can code things for fun and feel good about it as much as when you do it for profit.
And you really can’t put a price tag on feeling good.

It can become your personal bonsai tree or zen garden.
This type of activity can be relaxing and even therapeutic since it’s takes place in safe environment where no money and competition involved.
And still this process will challenge  you in a ways that are beneficial for your tech and problem solving skills development.

It’s can someday become a part of something public if you think it can be valuable for others, **but it’s not the main goal.**

**It’s just you having a good time in a way you like it, and you doing it [just because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb3FJdRk-tI).**
