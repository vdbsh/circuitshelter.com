Apple Books is a great way to listen Audible audiobooks offline on macos devices. It's handy and reliable. But looks like integration between these two are not perfect. When you try to [follow official instructions](https://help.audible.com/s/article/how-to-listen-to-audible-audiobooks-with-the-apple-books-app) there is a chance that after you get your signed link for Apple Books it's not gonna be accepted by the app.

So here is the workaround:
1. Open audiobook file
2. **Apple Books:** Authorize This Computer
3. **Apple Books:** **CLOSE THE APP!**
4. **Audible:** Activate in (iTunes) Apple Books
5. **Open signed link specifically in the Apple Books app (Not Music)**
