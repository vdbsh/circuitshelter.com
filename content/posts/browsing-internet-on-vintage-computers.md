## Highlights

### [FrogFind!](http://www.frogfind.com/)
The search functionality of FrogFind is basically a custom wrapper for DuckDuckGo search, converting the results to extremely basic HTML that old browsers can read. When clicking through to pages from search results, those pages are processed through a PHP port of Mozilla's Readability, which is what powers Firefox's reader mode. Then it further strip down the results to be as basic HTML as possible.

FrogFind designed with classic Macs in mind, so it's been tested on SE/30 to make sure it looks good in 1 bit color with a 512x384 resolution. Most of testing has been on Netscape 1.1N and 2.0.2, as well as a few 68k Mac versions of iCab. FrogFind should also work great on any text-based web browser!

### [The Old Net](http://theoldnet.com/)
The Old Net is a project to take you back to those early days of the WWW. Pulling in results from the Wayback Machine, it strips away all of the modern scripting from archive.org. Using a simple drop down menu, you can visit your favourite websites from the past as far back as 1994.
